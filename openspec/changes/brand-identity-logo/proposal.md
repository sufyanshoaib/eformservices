# Proposal: Brand Identity & Logo for eformly

## Problem Statement
The "eformly" platform currently lacks a distinct visual identity, including a logo. A professional, minimal, and memorable logo is needed to establish brand recognition and provide a cohesive look across the landing page, dashboard, and shared forms.

## Proposed Solution
Develop a brand identity centered around a minimal logo. The user has suggested a "funky" yet "minimal" design, possibly focusing on the letter "F" or the name "eformly".

Key elements of the proposal:
- Design a minimal logo featuring a stylized letter "F" or a combined "eformly" wordmark.
- Define a primary color palette and typography that aligns with the "premium" and "modern" aesthetic of the project.
- Integrate the logo into the platform (Navbar, Favicon, etc.).

## Alternatives Considered
- **Text-only logo**: Simple but lacks brand personality.
- **Complex illustrative logo**: May not scale well or fit the "minimal" requirement.

## Impact
- **User Experience**: Improved professional feel and brand trust.
- **Marketing**: Easier brand promotion and recognition.

## Dependencies
- Integration with the existing `create-landing-page` work (if applicable).
- Asset storage (Vercel Blob or `/public` folder).
