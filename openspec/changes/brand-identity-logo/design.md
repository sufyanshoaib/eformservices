# Design: Brand Identity & Logo

## Visual Direction
The design should feel:
- **Minimal**: Clean lines, simple shapes, no unnecessary clutter.
- **Funky**: A modern twist on traditional form-related imagery.
- **Premium**: Using high-quality colors and typography (e.g., Inter, Montserrat, or Outfit).

### Logo Concepts
1.  **The Stylized "F"**:
    - An "F" composed of two or three geometric shapes.
    - Top bar of the "F" looks like a document header.
    - Vertical stem looks like a form column.
    - Subtly incorporating a checkmark or a cursor.
2.  **The "e" + Form**:
    - A lowercase "e" that morphs into a form field or a paper fold.
3.  **Modern Wordmark**:
    - Custom typography for "eformly" where the "F" is the standout character.

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: A vibrant, trust-inducing Blue (#3B82F6) or Deep Purple (#6366F1).
- **Secondary**: A muted Grey or Off-white for background elements.
- **Accent**: A bright Teal or Orange for call-to-action elements.

### Typography
- **Headings**: Heading font (e.g., Outfit or Sora) for a modern, tech feel.
- **Body**: Clean Sans-Serif (e.g., Inter) for readability.

## Assets
- `logo_icon.svg`: The standalone mark.
- `logo_full.svg`: The wordmark + icon.
- `favicon.ico`: Optimized small-scale icon.

## Implementation Details
- Store primary assets in `/public/images/brand/`.
- Use a `Logo` component for consistency across the app.
